# Overview

This software was created to demonstrate the ability of kotlin to create an app within the Android studio software.

The reason that I am creating this program, is in an attempt to learn new languages and adapt to new enviorments.

# Development Environment

This software was created with the Android studio app that allows for the creation of said programs.
It is also the only software that I could find that would run Kotlin.

The language of Kotlin is very similar to java, but it is only usable in android studio.
