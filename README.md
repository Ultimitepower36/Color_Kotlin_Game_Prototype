# Overview

This software was created to demonstrate the ability of kotlin to create an app within the Android studio software.
This software currently does not run for reasons unknown to me. I submitted the code that I did create and did my
best to get it all in, however I am not sure as to that fact.

The reason that I am creating this program, is in an attempt to learn new languages and adapt to new enviorments.

# Development Environment

This software was created with the Android studio app that allows for the creation of said programs.
It is also the only software that I could find that would run Kotlin. 

The language of Kotlin is very similar to java, but it is only usable in android studio.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Get the app looking nice.
- Learn and implement newer and more complex code.
- Implement a wider range of colors
